                    <div class="collapsible-body frostEffect" style="color:white;"><span>Fluke Games, a registered trademark in India since 2020, began as a personal portfolio project. Our journey started with deploying a few games to online stores, crafted entirely by one person as a testament to individual creativity and skill. These projects were a showcase of passion and dedication, serving as stepping stones into the expansive gaming industry.
                        <br><br>
                    By 2022, Fluke Games evolved into something more. After starting work on an ambitious project and sharing the experience with peers in the gaming industry, the overwhelmingly positive feedback inspired us to pursue a polished, professional product. Since then, Fluke Games has been fueled by determination and collaboration, with contributions and support gathered from like-minded individuals across the internet.

                        Having spent years in the gaming industry, we understand the challenges aspiring creators face when trying to break into the field. A recurring question we encounter is how to land a job in this competitive space. One consistent piece of advice stands out: portfolio matters. A strong portfolio can open doors, and what better way to build one than by contributing to real-world projects? At Fluke Games, we provide opportunities for individuals to learn, grow, and showcase their abilities in meaningful ways.

                    Gaming is a multidisciplinary industry that thrives on collaboration. To create a polished product, expertise from various artistic and technical domains is crucial, and no single person can do it all. Recognizing this, Fluke Games offers an ideal environment for emerging talent to collaborate, learn, and contribute. We believe that the best results come from a collective effort, where diverse skills and ideas come together to create something extraordinary.
                    <br><br>
